Welcome! I'm so excited that you're here. If you're interested in gaining control of your money but don't know where to start, you're in the right place.

## Why I Became a Money Coach

I started Annie Cardinal Coaching as a way to provide others with the perspective and tools needed to build they life they want. Money can be a touchy subject, and I know that a lot of folks have trauma or shame surrounding money. I wanted to create a safe space for people to talk about money, ask questions, and take steps to build a healthy relationship with their finances.

Money can be a scary and nebulous topic. It’s often easier to hide behind a curtain of blissful ignorance, but in the long term this causes more harm than good. My goal is to empower you to make your own decisions through improved financial literacy.

Every person is at a different point in their journey. We all have different hopes and dreams. While I may have a certain set of priorities and circumstances, I understand that yours are unique to you. I'll work with you to create a custom system and coaching plan that'll set you on the right track.

## Finding a Balance

For me, it's about finding a balance between excessive spending and extreme frugality. I won't pretend to have mastered this balance, but I've had a lot of practice and am always re-evaluating my own priorities in life.

I used to have anxiety about splitting a bill with my friends. I would purposely order an inexpensive item and not share the appetizer or order a drink to save a few bucks, but they would then opt to split the bill evenly. I'd get so anxious and frustrated in these situations.

Now, I'm flexible enough to go with the flow and know that it's not worth the strain on the friendship to push back. I have money set aside for this and know that it won't impact my ability to pay for the necessities in life. On the other end of the spectrum, if a performer is coming to town who I'm not sure I'll get the chance to see again, I won't hesitate to buy tickets for that once-in-a-lifetime experience. I've got money set aside for that, too, so I can spend on my priorities guilt-free.

## Deciding Your Own Prioritites - and Sticking With Them

This flexibility and hierarchy of priorities was developed over years of self-reflection and conscious practice. I'm still learning, too. I'd like to help you build a system so that you can live your life and stop worrying about every purchase you make. You'll know the money is there for what matters most to you, and that your necessities and long-term savings are covered.

My philosophy surrounding money awareness takes time, patience, and effort. It will take work to become familiar with your money and face your fears. I’ll be here every step of the way to answer your questions and guide you through the process.
